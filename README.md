# pulse sensor + OLED Display+ Arduino
This Arduino code is used to calculate the Heart Beat from the Pulse Sensor module (https://pulsesensor.com/) and display the values as well as the Waveform on a  128x32 OLED display.

Code has been tested on Arduino Uno and Nano.

# Circuit Connection
Pulse sensor Out to Arduino A0
OLED SCL to Arduino A5
OLED SDA to Arduino A4
VCC to +5v
Gnd to Gnd

# Credits
This code is for Pulse Sensor Amped by Joel Murphy and Yury Gitman.Basic credits goes to them for creating the basic codes to calculate the Heart Beat.
